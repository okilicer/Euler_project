# allprojects
I am researching in the fields of the finite element methods for the Surface Stokes Equations.
I am adding python codes related to Project Euler problems, data science problems, and scientific computing problems

Note: I will not upload the problem solutions for Euler Project, if the problem number is above 100. I will upload them to there.
