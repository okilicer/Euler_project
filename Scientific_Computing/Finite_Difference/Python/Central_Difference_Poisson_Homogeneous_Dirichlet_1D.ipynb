#Generally we don't find to find the inverse of a matrix. It is costly. 
#However, in this case, Jacobi and/or Gauss-Seidel may diverge, 
#since the matrix we obtained is not strictly diagonally dominant.
#It will be costly to see that whether these methods converge or not. 
#There are modern itertive solvers. We will come to them later.

#Also, please don't use this code for bigger valued intervals with this test functions, 
#otherwise it will overflow, use scaling to obtain [0,1], for example. 
#Use min 3 points for [0,1] interval.
