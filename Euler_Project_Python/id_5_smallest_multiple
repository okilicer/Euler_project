# Explanation of the code: For the first loop, I found the prime numbers within that interval.
# Then, for the second loop, I found the lcm. Example: If I want to find the power of 2 inside 
# the interval for [1,5], then lets check the multiplictions: 1 x 2 x 3 x 2 * 2 x 5. 
# Now, as we can see, we have  2 * 2, it means that for the multiplication result, we have 4.
# So, the lcm will be 1 x 3 x 4 x 5.
