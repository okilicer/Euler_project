## Code explanation: This is a direct calculation. 
## Maybe we can use Gaussian formula to obtain summation, but this is OK.

import time

start = time.time()

def calculate_the_difference(n):
    sum_of_the_squares = 0
    square_of_the_sums = 0
    for i in range(n):
        sum_of_the_squares += (i+1)**2
        square_of_the_sums += i+1
    square_of_the_sums *= square_of_the_sums
    result = square_of_the_sums - sum_of_the_squares
    return result

print(calculate_the_difference(100))

print ("it took", time.time() - start, "seconds.")
