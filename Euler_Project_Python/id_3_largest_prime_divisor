## The code was written by Orsan Kilicer 7/3/2020 (July)

## Code explanation: Since we don't need to store the all prime numbers 
## that divide the number, we can divide it to the smallest prime number 
## and we can move to the point that we can obtain the largest prime divisor.

import time

start = time.time()

def largest_prime_divisor(n):
    j = 2
    while j < n:
        if n % j == 0:
            n /= j
            j = 2
        else:
            j += 1 
    return int(n)


print(largest_prime_divisor(600851475143))

print ("it took", time.time() - start, "seconds.")
