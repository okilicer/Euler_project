# I checked the values beforehand. The number a can be max 332, 
# since b can be 333 and c can be 335. On the other hand,
# if a is 1, then b can be max 499, since c > b. 
# This is brute force. Also, there is also a subtle approach.
# With playing algebra, we can get rid of c, and we can obtain
# a simpler algebric equation. Since, we know right hand side
# i.e., (1000 - b) * (1000 - a) = 5 * 10**5 = 2**5 * 5**6
# we can obtain an easier double-for loop.
