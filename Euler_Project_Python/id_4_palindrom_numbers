# I thought that the numbers should lie between 900 and 999. 
# So, I decided to look at this interval.
# This is a straightforward calculation, also by starting j from i, 
# I prevented repeating of the numbers. Then,I sorted the numbers and found the max
# palindrom number and the numbers that gives the result.
# Also, there is another way. These palindrom numbers should be divided to 11 
# (not all palindrom numbers are divided to 11, only the ones that has even number of 
# digits, i.e., 906609). If you consider this option, you can find the numbers can be divided to
# 11, and from this point, you can consider this.
